# to do

## test pkg with windows installation

Tested on Win11.
- works fine if you know possible hiccups
    - R, git, python 3.11 have to be in PATH
- instructions.txt helpful, but does not work 100% for windows
    - source is not a cmd command (just delete)
    - @5 should be <path/to/your/BirdNET-Analyzer/installation/>.venv\\**Scripts**\\activate (like in README -> backslash in windows)

- edit instructions according to file system?! or explain for both OS
- write functions to collect results from multiple sites.
